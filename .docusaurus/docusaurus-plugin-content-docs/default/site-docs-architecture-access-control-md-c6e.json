  "description": "Phase 3.4 adds a basic authorization layer to Agentâ€‘NN. Each agent receives a role and every action is checked against a role based permission map. The dispatcher loads the agent contract and calls is_authorized before a task is assigned. If the role is not allowed the task is blocked and an audit entry is written.",
