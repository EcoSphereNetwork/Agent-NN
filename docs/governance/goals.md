# Governance Goals

The Agent-NN modernization embraces the following principles:

- **Openness** – API specifications and code are publicly documented.
- **Extensibility** – Services and agents can be added without breaking existing contracts.
- **Security** – Authentication and scope based access protect all endpoints.
- **Datenschutz** – User data is processed according to GDPR and stored only as needed.

These goals guide decisions on new features, plugins and roles within the MCP system.
