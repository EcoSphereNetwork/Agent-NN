# Release Policy

The MCP services follow semantic versioning. Public APIs are considered stable within a major version.

Changes are documented in `CHANGELOG.md` and tagged in Git. Patch versions contain bug fixes only, minor versions add backwards compatible features. Breaking changes require a new major version and migration notes.
