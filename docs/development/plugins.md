# Service Plugins

The MCP architecture will support pluggable service components. Planned plugin types include:

- **Tools** – extend worker capabilities with external APIs
- **Chains** – compose multiple LLM calls
- **Hooks** – intercept messages or add custom logic

These plugins can be loaded by services at startup. Details will be defined in `ROADMAP_NEXT.md`.
