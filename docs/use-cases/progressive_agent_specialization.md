# Progressive Agent Specialization

Career tracks allow agents to gradually obtain more responsibilities.
A typical path could be:

1. **Retriever** – basic document lookup
2. **Analyst** – requires trust and the `research` skill
3. **Coordinator** – unlocked after further training and high reliability

Successful training and positive audit history increase the trust score. Once
the requirements are met the agent can be promoted automatically or via
`agentnn agent promote <name>`.
