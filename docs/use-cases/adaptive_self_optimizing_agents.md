# Adaptive Self-Optimizing Agents

Agents can refine their behaviour over time. A critic that receives many complaints will automatically increase its `precision` trait or learn new skills suggested by a model.

Run the evolution manually:

```bash
agentnn agent evolve critic_agent --mode heuristic
```
