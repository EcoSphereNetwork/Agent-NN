# Architecture Analysis

This file lists missing features and open tasks found during the code review. The list focuses on items required for the minimum viable product (MVP) as described in `README.md` and `Roadmap.md`.

## Outstanding Components

1. **LOH-Agent** – mentioned in the README as a planned agent type but no implementation exists.
2. **Agent Setup & Agent Framework** – referenced as upcoming work; no code present yet.
3. **SupervisorAgent Tests** – `test_supervisor_agent.py` is still missing and coverage of the supervisor logic is absent.
4. **Logging Configuration** – Roadmap marks `logging_util.py` configuration and error logging as incomplete; several modules do not use the `LoggerMixin` yet.
5. **Integration Tests** – broader system tests (especially for inter-agent communication and domain retrieval) are sparse.
6. **CLI and API Completion** – some CLI commands and FastAPI endpoints are present but the full workflow integration is not finished.

These gaps must be addressed to reach a functional MVP that matches the roadmap expectations.
