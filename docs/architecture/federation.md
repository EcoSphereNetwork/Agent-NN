# Federation Manager

The Federation Manager coordinates tasks across multiple Agent-NN clusters. Nodes
can be registered via the API and tasks are forwarded to the selected cluster.

```

Use `/nodes` to register a remote instance and `/dispatch/{name}` to send tasks.
The service keeps a heartbeat timestamp for each node and removes entries after
60 seconds without contact. A round-robin dispatcher chooses the next available
node while considering the number of active tasks.
