# Agent-NN Documentation

Welcome to the Agent-NN documentation! This documentation will help you understand and use our multi-agent system with neural network-based task routing.
Current stable version: **v1.0.3**.

## Overview

Agent-NN is a sophisticated multi-agent system that combines large language models (LLMs) with neural networks to create an intelligent task routing and execution framework. The system features:

- Dynamic agent creation and specialization
- Neural network-based task routing
- Integrated knowledge management
- Advanced security and monitoring
- Comprehensive evaluation system

## Key Features

### Multi-agent System
- Dynamic agent creation and management
- Specialized worker agents for different domains
- Inter-agent communication and collaboration
- Task routing and delegation

### Neural Intelligence
- Neural network-based task matching
- Performance optimization through learning
- Feature extraction and analysis
- Adaptive agent selection

### Knowledge Management
- Integrated vector store
- Domain-specific knowledge bases
- Document ingestion and retrieval
- Semantic search capabilities

### Security & Monitoring
- Token-based authentication
- Input validation and filtering
- Rate limiting and access control
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

### Evaluation & Analysis
- Performance metrics tracking
- A/B testing framework
- Cost analysis and optimization
- System-wide monitoring

## Getting Started
For a practical introduction, see the [User Guide](BenutzerHandbuch/index.md).
